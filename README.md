Septimus
========

[Septimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimus_%28praenomen%29) is a driver
board to control large seven segments displays. It is designed for four
characters and has its own step-up converter to produce the large voltage
needed by the large seven segments displays.

The display is controlled by an ATtiny2313. The display is controlled through
the two-wire interface of the microcontroller.

All the components are commonly available discrete through-hole parts.
